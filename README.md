# Autograding Using LLMs

## Workflow

1. Reference solution is required
    1. Provided by instructor
    2. Generated by AI, but approved/edited by instructor
2. Select problem type, or have the instructor select it
3. Select programming language, or have the instructor select it
4. LLM: Generate detailed problem description
5. LLM: Generate test cases based on the detailed problem description:
    1. Find edge cases
    2. Reflect on them 
    3. Generate tests (edge + random)
       - Tests compare the result of calling the student's function with the result of calling the instructor solution on the same input 
    4. Run them if possible (not possible - student solution is missing in this workflow)
6. Run tests and drop any test that crashes the instructor solution
